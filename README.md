# question-answering-system
A hybrid question-answering system for member messages. Uses rule-based extraction for deterministic answers (dates, counts, locations, preferences) and optional LLM fallback for descriptive or vague queries. Built with FastAPI and modular components for retrieval, NLU, and answer extraction.
